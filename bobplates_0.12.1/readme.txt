* Swapped stats of Steel pipe with Plastic pipe, and Titanium pipe with Ceramic pipe to make the chains make more sense
* Added 2 new intermediate catagories: Fluids, which contains all the fluid (and gas) recipes, and Resources, which contains all resource/material type intermediates, such as metal plates
* Changed the "Gas" type fluids to have the same flow as water, I wasn't happy with the ripple effect caused by what the devs describe as "the simulation becomes unstable".

* Added Nitrogen chain and research.
* Added Cermics research, Silicon powder, Silicon nitride, Ceramic pipes, and Ceramic bearings.
* Added Lithium chain and research.
* Added Cobalt chain and resarch.
* Reballanced factory energy consumptions (Higher levels use more power, but still less per build cycle).
* Added mk4 chemical plant at old mk3 speed, rescaled mk3 to between 2 and the new 4.
* Added new Chemical plant graphics! (Recolours for MK2 to MK4).
* Titanium Bearings, Nitinol Bearings and Ceramic Bearings now require Lubricant to make.
* Added Copper, Steel, Bronze, Plastic, Brass, Titanium, Ceramic and Tungsten pipes.
* Added gas bottling research, facility and recipies for Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Chlorine, Hydrogen chloride and Petroleum gas.
* Added barrelling research, facility and recipies for Heavy oil, Light oil, Sulfuric Acid, Lubricant and a duplicate Crude oil for the new facility.
* Added Electrolyser graphics by Yuoki Tani!
* Gas type fluids now have a higher flow value, including Petroleum Gas.
* Reduced the flow value slightly on heavy oil and crude oil. (it's thick and viscous, it moves slowly)


v0.6.1
* Added missing name for Glass to locale file.
* Changed the grouping of the intermediates to use a recipe factory type (assembly, smelting, chemical, electrolysis, mixing etc) in the recipe lists.
* The item lists (shown when using logistics) has minor changes to seperate the resources (EG glass and salt) into 2 sections: resources and chemical solids.


v0.6.0
* Merged Intermediates into this mod.
* A few more minor tweaks to tech tree
* Added Chemical Plant MK2 and MK3
* Added Electrolyser MK2 and MK3
* Added another high end Furnace


v0.5.4
* Chemical Furnace and Mixing Furnace now run on Burner power as originally intended!

* Added graphics for Mixing Furnace
* Added icons for all 4 new furnaces
* Renamed Silicon internally from silicon-plate to silicon, making it the same as in DyTech
* Added Silicon wafer recipe, this replaces the industrio wafer recipe, since with this mod you can't make silicon boules anyway.
* Moved new intermediate catagories to my own "Bob's Intermediates" tab, to prevent the window being too big for the screen.


v0.5.2
* Added new graphics for Chemical Furnace (both) and Mixing Furnace (MK2)
* Lead now has its own chain and research.
* Added Nickel and research, which is needed to make Tungsten plates.
* Added by-product sulfur dioxide that can be used to make sulfur or sulfuric acid.
