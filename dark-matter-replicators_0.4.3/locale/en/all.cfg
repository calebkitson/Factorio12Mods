[technology-description]
dark-matter-scoop=Normally dark matter passes through all other matter, interacting only through gravity.  However, this planet contains clusters of an unusual type of crystal.  When an electric current is run through this type of crystal, it physically interacts with an unseen substance that is currently theorized to be dark matter.  Furthermore, when enough electricity is run through an arrangement of these crystals some this dark matter can changed into regular matter.  This substance has been named tenemut, based on the Latin words for dark (tenebris) and change (mutatio).  With additional research it should become possible to choose what substances are produced by this process.
dark-matter-transducer=Dark matter scoops do a good enough job of transforming dark matter into normal matter, if you don't particularly care what your new matter consists of.  Of course, replication which uses scoops alone is rather limited.  More advanced replication will require some form of quality control.  Given the details of the replication process, an extra component which moves the dark matter as it becomes normal matter should do the trick.
matter-conduit=While it is theoretically possible to replicate any substance using just dark matter scoops and transducers, controlling the resulting shapes of those substances is difficult.  This is a problem when trying to replicate technology because many technological devices have very small components.  For example, the integrated circuits used in computers can be mere nanometers across.  The solution to this problem is to invent a new component which can interact with the partially transformed dark matter so that all of the replicated substances form in just the right place.
expansion-bay=Matter conduits have some interesting properties.  While they were invented to make precise changes to partially transformed dark matter, it was discovered during their development that these changes can involve moving two partially replicated components through each other.  Further research suggested that matter conduits may be able to apply dark matter's property of non-interaction to normal matter.  While phasing large objects is a long way out, it seems like it would be rather easy to use matter conduits to continuously fine tune the internals of nearby machines.
electric-smelting=When an electric current is run through tenemut in a way that does not produce matter, the tenemut instead interacts with dark matter via motion.  While it first seemed that this motion could be harnessed to generate electricity, tenemut converts too much of its input electricity into waste heat for this to be a practical form of power generation.  However, as this heat is localised around the tenemut it could be used to produce a simple, if inefficient, electric furnace.
